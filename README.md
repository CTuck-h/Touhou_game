This project is a high-performance, bare-metal implementation of a bullet-hell style arcade game developed for the Texas Instruments MSP432 (ARM Cortex-M4). It features a custom non-blocking C game engine designed to manage real-time graphics, collision detection, and complex projectile patterns. By utilizing a hierarchical state machine, the system synchronizes asynchronous user inputs from a 2-axis joystick with hardware timers and LCD SPI communication to ensure deterministic game logic and fluid 60FPS performance without a real-time operating system (RTOS).
